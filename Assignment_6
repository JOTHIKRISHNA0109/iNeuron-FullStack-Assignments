1) Keywords in Python are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names or function names). 
To print all the keywords in python, you can run the below piece of code..
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

2)i) Should not start with numbers 
ii) Should start with alphabets or underscore.
iii) Should not be one among the reserved keywords
iv) Should contain only alphabets, digits or underscore.

3) Use descriptive names use lowercase letters and underscores, avoid using reserved keywords, use constants in uppercase and use any one of the  snake case or camel case consistently.

4) Your interpreter will throw an error stating invalid syntax.

5) 'def' in python is used to declare a function. For example,
def functionName():

6) The special character '\' is used as an escape character. It is used to escape or indicate special characters or sequences within a string or character literal. The '\' is followed by another character to create an escape sequence.

7.1) [2,4,6,8,10,11]
7.2) {"Hello",3,True}
7.3) ("Sun","Moon")

8) Immutable data types are those which can't be modified. On trying to modify or reassign, new reference gets created.
Eg. Int, float, tuple etc.
Mutable data types are those which can be modified and on modification, it does not create any new instance but directly impacts the object itself. Eg. List, Dictionary, set etc.

9) 
rows = int(input())
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(rows - i - 1):
        print(" ", end="")
    
    for k in range(2*i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    
    print()
    
10) 
rows = int(input())
end = rows + (rows-1)
for i in range(1,rows+1):
  count = 1
  for j in range(1,rows+1):
     if j<i:
        print(" ")
     elif j>=i:
        print("|")
        count+=1
        
  print()
  end-=2
